It has been tested on Windows 11. To run it simply compile all cpp files. The exe file can be found <a href="https://stranger.quebec">here</a>

# Stand Alone
This version is highly Compromised to make it work as fast as I could. The bots have been removed and loading map is changed so it doesn't read the map from extra file. There are plenty of legacy code that has been removed. a new branch based on unity will be released soon to fix the problems I faced with this project.
